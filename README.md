## Phase Ⅱ: Data Cleaning and Analysis

Once the data is gathered, the subsequent phase involves meticulous data cleaning and analysis. The objective here is to ensure data accuracy and to derive insights through various statistical and visual means. This includes data manipulation, and handling missing values, and outliers. The analysis involves plotting diverse charts, such as bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and more, to uncover trends and patterns within the anime dataset.
